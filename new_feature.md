In this project, the new feature I tried to implement was correct periodic table formatting as opposed to a regular grid. I encountered this stuck feature in previously working on the interactive periodic table for the 10 projects assignment.

This is a reasonable feature to expect in a frontend project because it just has to do with formatting and is not a complex code instruction. It should display the elements in the format of the periodic table, in the odd, irregular shaped grid that is standard and most recognizeable.

Chatgpt continually created a squarish grid that contained all the elements. Or, if it did create a grid and separated H and He, the first two elements on opposite sides of the standar periodic table, the rest of the elements did not appear correctly.

----
I included two conversations from ChatGPT where I asked it repeatedly to fix this but I couldn't get it to work. I actually have many other conversations trying to figure it out or get all 118 elements generated, or where chatgpt created my website but with react (so it was nixed), but these are most relevant.

Additionally, I consulted gemini and claude. (bc I confess I don't have chatgpt pro and ran out of messages so I hopped around. Another benefit of this was to see different implementations of different GPTs to try different qualitites of code)

Out of these many conversations I created several iterations of worse websites of varying degrees of quality. I stuck with the one that had the best color, UX, and formatting.

---
Important note: Un/fortunately, at some point after many attempts, right at the end, I did get the periodic table formatting to work, using claude. The third conversation from claude I included, and it was a continuation of a past conversation and failed attempt before it worked.

For frankness' sake I included this code as well. But really, the iteration was failing for the 90% of my attempts. :(
